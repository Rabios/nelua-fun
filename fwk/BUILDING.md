# Building

The bindings requires [FWK](https://github.com/r-lyeh/FWK) so:

1. `make download` to download required files.
2. `make test` to run!

> NOTICE: Nelua FWK examples other than `fwk_demo.nelua` requires full repo along with files so you copy bindings and example to FWK directory and compile there...
