# Building

The test requires binary distribution of [SIGIL](http://libsigil.com) so:

1. Download the build depending on your platfornm from downloads there...
2. Create folder named `lib` in this directory.
3. Put `libsigil.dll.a` or `libsigil.lib` in `lib` directory.
4. `make test`
5. Put shared libs that comes with SIGIL beside the output executable!
6. Run!
